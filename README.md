# Production scripts collection

Here there are many scripts I have written when I worked in production.

## The systems I was monitoring in production

* Mainly a system that managed financial transactions
* Database servers running on IBM AIX systems
* The entire datacentre had around 300 servers

## Goals

* Make sure that the systems were running smoothly having to guarantee quick response to any problem.
* Make sure our SLA (Service Level Agreement) were respected.

## Achievements

* I earned a very good understanding of how production works. 
* Thanks to this experience I now know how to write an application that is easy to troubleshoot in production and that doesn't leave you in the dark when things go wrong.

## Technologies

* bash
* perl
* Sybase sql
* Sybase stored procedures
